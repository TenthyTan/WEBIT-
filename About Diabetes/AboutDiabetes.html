    <p>Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia 
        is caused by defective insulin secretion, impaired biological action, or both. 
        Long-term hyperglycemia leads to chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, 
        especially the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. </p></div>

    <h2>Etiology</h2>
    <p>1. Genetic factors: There is significant genetic heterogeneity in both type 1 and type 2 
        diabetes. Diabetes has a family history, and 1/4 to 1/2 of the patients have a family 
        history of diabetes.</p> 
    <p>2. Envirnmental factor: Obesity caused by overeating and reduced physical activity is 
        the most important environmental factor for type 2 diabetes, predisposing individuals 
        with genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.</p>
    <p>Type 1 diabetes patients have an abnormal immune system, which leads to an autoimmune 
        response after infection with certain viruses such as coxsackie virus, rubella virus, 
        and parotid virus, which destroy insulin beta cells. </p>   
    
    <h2>Clinical manifestations </h2>
    <p>1. Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss</p>
    <p>The typical symptoms of "three more and one less" appear in severe hyperglycemia, which 
        is more common in type 1 diabetes. When ketosis or ketoacidosis occurs, the symptoms of 
        "three more and one less" are more obvious.</p>
    <p>2. fatigue, obesity</p>
    <p>More common in type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is often preceded by obesity, and if not 
        diagnosed in time, weight will gradually decrease.</p>
    <p>At present, there is no cure for diabetes, but it can be well controlled through a variety
         of treatments. It mainly includes five aspects: education of diabetic patients, 
         self-monitoring of blood sugar, diet therapy, exercise therapy and drug therapy. </p>
