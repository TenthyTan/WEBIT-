                            <p class="text-center">Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia.
                                Hyperglycemia is caused by defective insulin secretion, Long-term hyperglycemia leads to
                                chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, especially the eyes, kidneys, heart,
                                blood vessels, and nerves. </p>

                    <div class="text-center">
                        <p>1. Genetic factors: There is significant genetic heterogeneity in both type 1 and type 2
                            diabetes. Diabetes has a family history, and 1/4 to 1/2 of the patients have a family
                            history of diabetes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <p>2. Envirnmental factor: Obesity caused by overeating and reduced physical activity is the
                            most important environmental factor for type 2 diabetes, predisposing individuals with
                            genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="text-center">
                        <p>Type 1 diabetes patients have an abnormal immune system, which leads to an autoimmune
                            response after infection with certain viruses such as coxsackie virus, rubella virus, and
                            parotid virus, which destroy insulin beta cells. </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3 class="text-center"><b>Clinical manifestations</b></h3>
                    <p class="text-center">1. Polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss</p>
                    <p class="text-center">The typical symptoms of "three more and one less" appear in severe hyperglycemia, which is more
                        common in type 1 diabetes. When ketosis or ketoacidosis occurs, the symptoms of "three more and
                        one less" are more obvious.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">2. fatigue, obesity</p>
                    <p class="text-center">More common in type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is often preceded by obesity, and if not
                        diagnosed in time, weight will gradually decrease.</p>
                    <p class="text-center">At present, there is no cure for diabetes, but it can be well controlled through a variety of
                        treatments. It mainly includes five aspects: education of diabetic patients, self-monitoring of
                        blood sugar, diet therapy, exercise therapy and drug therapy. </p>
